            <h1>About Save Life Connect</h1><br>
                What is this all about? <br>
                Project Save Life Connect is an innovative approach to address global health. We provide immediate access to blood donors all over Pakistan, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week! <br>
                Save Life Connect is one of several community organizations working together as a network that respond to disasters or emergency situations in an efficient manner. <br>
                <h1>What we do?</h1>
                The ultimate goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use, easy-to-access, efficient, and reliable way to get life-saving blood, free of cost. <br>
                 Save Life Connect works with network partners to connect blood donors and recipients through an automated SMS (text messaging) service or our mobile application. <br>
                  Our network of volunteer blood donors are ready to help save lives any time, any place. <br>

                <h1>How it works?</h1>
                Our automated system works efficiently whenever someone needs a blood transfusion. Simply post a blood a request within our system, either on this website or by downloading our mobile app. <br> As soon as a new blood request is raised, it is routed among our local volunteer blood donors. <br>
                 We know time matters! So we keep you updated with real-time notifications sent directly to you via SMS (text message) or the installed mobile app. <br> Instead of having to search all over for a blood donor in an emergency situation, you can spend your time consoling the patient. <br> We keep you updated at each step of the request process, from when a volunteer has been found to when blood is on its way.

                <h1>Don't have access to internet?</h1>
                In case, someone is unable to use the mobile application or the website or has not enough knowledge to understand how they can find a blood donor in an emergency, we have an automated SMS (text message) service. <br> 
                All you need to do is send a text message to 8655, "blood need <bloodgroup> in <your-city>". <br>
                     It does not need to be in english, you can write in any language you want. Our automated systems are smart enough to understand everything you write <br> And will interact with you and help you find a blood donor within seconds if not minutes.
